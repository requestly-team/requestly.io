              "At 15gifts, they provide a Javascript tag that their clients integrate into their websites. Their JS tag provides a guided shopping experience similar to in-store sales assistants. They wanted to test out the integration behavior on existing as well as potential customers sites. Which questions the sales assistant asks and at what point in the user journey and what recommendations etc are shown – are some parts of their testing workflow.",
              "The team also wanted to test that new features run smoothly or break the integration and explore this. Any broken experience on the customer website can lead to significant loss for the customer, therefore testing their JS tag on external sites is extremely important for them."

With this setup, they are able to run their staging environment code on live production sites without changing a thing. They use <a href=\"https://requestly.io/blog/requestly-rule-operators/\" class=\"customer-story-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"> Requestly WildCard operator  </a> to create rules which work across multiple customers/projects.
