Requestly in collaboration with Roc8 hosted Moonshot, a hackathon with the goal to attract, support, and, provide an opportunity to developers from all-tier college grads across India with a chance to showcase their work.

**The theme of the hackathon**: Web Development Tooling

Moonshot is a free online hackathon where people can participate solo or in a team of max 2 people.
Prizes for the winners and finalists include: Cash prizes worth Rs. 20,000 for the winners, career opportunities at Requestly and a wild card to the roc8 community to all the finalists.

## Team formation and Ideation Workshop

This is a pre-hackathon event held to help the participants who:

* Have an idea, need help with the team,
* Have a team member, need help with idea,
* Need help with idea and a team member.

The workshop began with 70 people who came up with 40 raw ideas, a few of which we discussed, validated as needed, and, went ahead with the team formation exercise. By the end of the event everyone had an idea to work on and a teammate to work with, if wanted to work as a team.

## Conclusion

With this Hackathon, Our core goal was to achieve  attract, support, and, provide an opportunity to the young talent. We wanted to introduce a way of adding value to one’s profile that has a potential to open new paths in their career - Proof of work. We challenged developers on socials to participate in the hackathon to create a proof of their work ideated, built, and, launched over a weekend of time. Around 25% of the participants shared that this is their 1st ever participating in a hackathon and that is a win for us as they are going to see the opportunities in a different angle and are 1 step ahead of their competition in careers. <br>
