Hey Requestlian üëã,

In this newsletter, I bring the latest Requestly developments in the month of Sep'22. Despite having many popular Mock Servers, developing frontend when APIs are not ready is painful. Developers often resort to hard-code JSON they get from backend developers while developing the UI. We took a jab at solving this, So Instead of hardcoding JSON in the code, define the JSON in the Requestly Modify API Response rule and keep it there forever, no more removing it before creating pull requests or hacking around your code base. Quickly enable/disable with a single click. Sharing is easy and whatnot. Now you can use <a href="https://requestly.io/feature/modify-response/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>Modify API response</u></a> for the following use cases

<ul>
  <li>Develop UI when the APIs are not ready (Non-existent endpoints)</li>
  <li>Modify API Responses programmatically to simulate error paths in code flows (Existent endpoints)</li>
</ul>

Here's a quick demo video that I created on Loom -

<h2>Charles Proxy alternative üî•</h2>

Requestly continues to be the best, modern, <a href="https://requestly.io/charles-proxy-alternative/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>lightweight alternative to Charles Proxy</u></a> when it comes to web debugging. We keep getting feedback from our users about how much they love Requestly after moving from Charles. We published a blog post showing different things Requestly simplifies.<br>

Here are a couple of references we found on the Internet this month: <br>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Requestly brings the power of Charles Proxy in the browser! If you are a web developer, you gotta try it (<a href="https://t.co/FsCVBlL3Z2">https://t.co/FsCVBlL3Z2</a>)</p>&mdash; Michael Thomas (@MikeThomasDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeThomasDev/status/1577774519929929729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <br>

<h2>Adobe &amp; Requestly (The love saga continues..‚ù§Ô∏è)</h2><br>

Requestly continues to be one of the favorite tools to swap tag management libraries across environments. Digital Analytics consultants and Implementation managers use Requestly extensively to swap libraries and inject custom scripts on their client websites, and sometimes also modify the request/response headers &amp; API responses. When it comes to swapping out Adobe Launch libraries across environments, Requestly is one of the most loved tools as said by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6967851411980046337/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>Andy Lunsford in his LinkedIn post.</u></a></p>
<p>We also published how you can <a href="https://requestly.io/blog/replace-adobe-launch-production-script-with-development-script/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>load the development version of the Adobe launch tag </u> </a> in the production sites. </p>
<p>One of our users funnily mentioned this to me in our LinkedIn conversation. This couldn't be better expressed than this.

<h2>Bug Fixing &amp; Performance Improvements ‚ö°Ô∏è</h2><br>

We improved app loading performance significantly and took down the page loading time from 9s to less than 1s. We primarily optimized on caching Firebase queries &amp; a few other things. We will soon share our learnings as a blog post. <br>
Based on a feature request, we added the capability to add description &amp; start time offset while sharing a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_qXQAzUQgU" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"> session recording with teammates.</a></p>
<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/blog-images/sesh-record.png" alt="adobe and RQ" width="1000"/> </p>

<h2>Highlights | Requestly on Web üí™üèª</h2><br>

<a href="https://devtools.tech/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>Devtools.tech</u></a> is a great place to know about JS, React, and developer tools. We stumbled upon a recent video from them where they explain how web developers can supercharge their development &amp; testing workflows using Requestly.
